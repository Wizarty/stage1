## Properties for the Children  
(flex items)

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/order.svg)

```css
.item { 
	order: 5;  /\* default is 0 \*/ 
	}
```
By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the `order` property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
