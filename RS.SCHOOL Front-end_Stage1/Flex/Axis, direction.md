#flex

The `flex-direction` property accepts four possible values:

-   `row`: same as text direction (default)
-   `row-reverse`: opposite to text direction
-   `column`: same as `row` but top to bottom
-   `column-reverse`: same as `row-reverse` top to bottom

### Syntax

```css
flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
```
